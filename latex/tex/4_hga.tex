\section{Hierarchical Genetic Algorithm} 
In this work, we define the \emph{feature} of a web component as a code snippet that implements a specified behavior that the users interest. 
Our method uses test-cases to specify what behaviors the user like, that is, our method will find a minimum size of code snippet which can pass all of the user-specified test-cases. 
We propose a hierarchical genetic algorithm to achieve the goal. 

\subsection{Problem Formulation} 
\begin{definition}
Given a set of test-cases $T$, for a code snippet $CS$ from a web component $C$, we say the $CS$ is the desired features which satisfies:
